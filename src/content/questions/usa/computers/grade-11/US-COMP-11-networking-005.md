# Question
Which algorithm does OSPF use to calculate the shortest path in a network?

# Options
- [ ] A) Bellman-Ford algorithm
- [x] B) Dijkstra's algorithm
- [ ] C) Floyd-Warshall algorithm
- [ ] D) Prim's algorithm

# Explanation
OSPF uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path tree. This algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the network.
- A) Bellman-Ford is used by distance-vector protocols like RIP
- C) Floyd-Warshall calculates shortest paths between all pairs of nodes
- D) Prim's algorithm is used for minimum spanning trees, not routing
