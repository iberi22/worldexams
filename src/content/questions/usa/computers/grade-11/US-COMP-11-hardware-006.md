# Question
What is the approximate value of an original Apple I computer today?

# Options
- [ ] A) $1,000 - $5,000
- [ ] B) $10,000 - $50,000
- [x] C) $200,000 - $500,000
- [ ] D) Over $1,000,000

# Explanation
Original Apple I computers have sold at auction for between $200,000 and $500,000, with some rare specimens reaching even higher prices. This is because only about 200 were made in 1976, and only a small number survive today, making them extremely rare and valuable to collectors.
- A) $1,000 - $5,000: This significantly underestimates their collector value
- B) $10,000 - $50,000: This is still too low for these rare computers
- D) Over $1,000,000: While one sold for $905,000 in 2014, most are in the C range
