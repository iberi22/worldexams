# Explanation
A Tahr is a large Himalayan wild goat found in the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. Ubuntu chose this animal for the 14.04 LTS release "Trusty Tahr." Ubuntu releases use real and mythical animals, but "Mystic Mansion" was never used as it doesn't follow the naming convention.

- D) Tahr is not a programming term
