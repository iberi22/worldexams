# Question
Which routing protocol uses the Open Shortest Path First algorithm?

# Options
- [ ] A) RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- [x] B) OSPF
- [ ] C) BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
- [ ] D) EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)

# Explanation
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is the routing protocol that uses Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. It's widely used in enterprise networks.
- A) RIP uses distance-vector routing, not shortest path first
- C) BGP uses path-vector routing for internet routing
- D) EIGRP uses a hybrid approach with DUAL algorithm
