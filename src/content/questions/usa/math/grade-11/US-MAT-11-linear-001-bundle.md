# Original Question
If $3x - 9 = 12$, what is the value of $2x$?

## Options
- [ ] A) 7
- [ ] B) 12
- [x] C) 14
- [ ] D) 21

## Explanation
1. Solve for $x$: $3x = 21 \rightarrow x = 7$.
2. Find $2x$: $2(7) = 14$.

# Low Difficulty Variants

## Variant 1
Solve for $x$: $x + 5 = 12$.

### Options
- [ ] A) 5
- [x] B) 7
- [ ] C) 17
- [ ] D) 8

### Explanation
Subtract 5 from both sides: $x = 12 - 5 = 7$.

## Variant 2
What is the slope of the line $y = 3x + 4$?

### Options
- [x] A) 3
- [ ] B) 4
- [ ] C) 7
- [ ] D) -3

### Explanation
In $y = mx + b$, $m$ is the slope. Here $m=3$.

# Medium Difficulty Variants

## Variant 1
A line passes through $(0, 2)$ and $(2, 6)$. What is its equation?

### Options
- [ ] A) $y = 2x$
- [x] B) $y = 2x + 2$
- [ ] C) $y = 4x + 2$
- [ ] D) $y = 2x + 4$

### Explanation
Slope $m = (6-2)/(2-0) = 4/2 = 2$. Y-intercept is given as $(0,2)$, so $b=2$. Eq: $y=2x+2$.

## Variant 2
If $5(x - 2) = 15$, what is $x$?

### Options
- [ ] A) 3
- [x] B) 5
- [ ] C) 4
- [ ] D) 7

### Explanation
Divide by 5: $x - 2 = 3$. Add 2: $x = 5$.

# High Difficulty Variants

## Variant 1
A gym charges a $\$50$ joining fee and $\$30$ per month. If a member paid a total of $\$290$, how many months have they been a member?

### Options
- [ ] A) 6
- [x] B) 8
- [ ] C) 9
- [ ] D) 7

### Explanation
Equation: $30m + 50 = 290$. $30m = 240 \rightarrow m = 8$.

## Variant 2
The sum of two numbers is 20 and their difference is 4. What is the larger number?

### Options
- [x] A) 12
- [ ] B) 10
- [ ] C) 16
- [ ] D) 8

### Explanation
$x + y = 20$, $x - y = 4$. Add them: $2x = 24 \rightarrow x = 12$. Larger is 12.
