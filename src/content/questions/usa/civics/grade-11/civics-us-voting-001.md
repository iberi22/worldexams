# Question
What is the minimum age to vote in federal elections in the United States?

# Options
- [ ] A) 16
- [x] B) 18
- [ ] C) 21
- [ ] D) 25

# Explanation
The 26th Amendment, ratified in 1971, lowered the voting age from 21 to 18 for all federal and state elections. This was partly in response to the Vietnam War, when 18-year-olds could be drafted but couldn't vote.
- A) 16: Some states allow for local elections
- C) 21: Previous voting age before 1971
- D) 25: Age requirement for House of Representatives
