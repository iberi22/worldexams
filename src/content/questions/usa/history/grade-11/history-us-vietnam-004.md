# Question
What was the Tet Offensive, which significantly impacted American public opinion about the Vietnam War?

# Options
- [ ] A) A U.S. naval blockade of North Vietnam
- [x] B) A major coordinated attack by North Vietnamese forces on cities including Saigon during the lunar new year in 1968
- [ ] C) A peace treaty signed in Saigon
- [ ] D) A chemical weapons program

# Explanation
The Tet Offensive (January-February 1968) was a massive coordinated attack by North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces on over 100 South Vietnamese cities, including Saigon. Although militarily repelled, the offensive shocked Americans who had been told the war was being won. The attack on the U.S. Embassy in Saigon particularly undermined public confidence, leading to President Johnson's decision not to seek re-election.
- A) Naval blockade: Not what the Tet Offensive was
- C) Peace treaty: Tet was an attack, not a peace agreement
- D) Chemical weapons: Not the Tet Offensive
