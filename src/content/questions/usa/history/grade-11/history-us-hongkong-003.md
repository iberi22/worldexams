# Question
What principle governed Hong Kong's return to China in 1997?

# Options
- [ ] A) Complete integration into China's political system
- [x] B) "One country, two systems" maintaining Hong Kong's autonomy
- [ ] C) Full independence as a city-state
- [ ] D) Joint British-Chinese administration

# Explanation
The "one country, two systems" principle, negotiated by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, guaranteed that Hong Kong would retain its capitalist economic system and democratic institutions for 50 years after the 1997 handover. This arrangement influenced U.S. policy toward China and Hong Kong, particularly regarding trade relations and human rights concerns.
- A) Complete integration: Contrary to the negotiated agreement
- C) Full independence: Hong Kong did not become independent
- D) Joint administration: Not the arrangement that was made
