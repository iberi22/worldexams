Hong Kong was returned to China on July 1, 1997, under the "one country, two systems" principle that promised Hong Kong would maintain its capitalist economy and democratic freedoms for 50 years (until 2047). The handover occurred during Bill Clinton's presidency and represented a major geopolitical shift that impacted U.S.-China relations and American economic interests in Asia.

- D) 2001: Four years after the actual handover
