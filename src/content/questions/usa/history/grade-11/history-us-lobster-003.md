# Question
What was the central dispute in the Lobster War between France and Brazil?

# Options
- [ ] A) Territorial claims over islands
- [x] B) Whether lobsters walk on the continental shelf or swim in international waters
- [ ] C) Ownership of fishing vessels
- [ ] D) Trade tariffs on seafood

# Explanation
The core of the Lobster War was a biological and legal debate about lobster behavior. Brazil argued that lobsters "walk" on its continental shelf, making them Brazilian resources. France claimed lobsters "swim" in international waters, thus available to French fishermen. This seemingly absurd dispute had serious implications for maritime law and economic zones.
- A) Territorial claims: Not the primary issue, though related
- C) Ownership of fishing vessels: Not the central dispute
- D) Trade tariffs: Not the focus of this conflict
