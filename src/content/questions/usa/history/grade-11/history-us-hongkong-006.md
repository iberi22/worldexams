# Question
What concern has emerged regarding Hong Kong in recent years that affects U.S. foreign policy?

# Options
- [ ] A) Hong Kong's complete independence from China
- [x] B) China's erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic freedoms
- [ ] C) Britain's attempt to recolonize Hong Kong
- [ ] D) Hong Kong becoming a U.S. territory

# Explanation
Since the 1997 handover, particularly after 2014's Umbrella Movement and 2019-2020 pro-democracy protests, China has increasingly restricted Hong Kong's autonomy and democratic freedoms, contrary to the "one country, two systems" promise. In 2020, China imposed a National Security Law that further curtailed freedoms. These developments have prompted U.S. sanctions and legislative responses, including the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (2019), making Hong Kong a significant point of tension in U.S.-China relations.
- A) Complete independence: Not the current issue
- C) British recolonization: Not occurring or being attempted
- D) U.S. territory: Not a realistic or pursued option
