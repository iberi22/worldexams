# Explanation
Hong Kong was returned to China on July 1, 1997, marking the symbolic end of the British Empire. Britain had controlled Hong Kong since 1842 following the First Opium War. The handover ceremony represented the conclusion of centuries of British colonial expansion and reflected the post-Cold War shift in global power dynamics that affected U.S. strategic interests in Asia.

- B) Australia: Became independent progressively; still part of Commonwealth
- C) Ireland: Most of Ireland gained independence in 1922
