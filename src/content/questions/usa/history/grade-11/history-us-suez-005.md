# Question
How did the Suez Canal influence American foreign policy during the Eisenhower administration?

# Options
- [ ] A) It led to direct U.S. military occupation of Egypt
- [x] B) The Suez Crisis demonstrated U.S. willingness to oppose European colonialism even when countering Soviet influence
- [ ] C) It resulted in the U.S. purchasing the canal from France
- [ ] D) It had no significant impact on U.S. policy

# Explanation
The 1956 Suez Crisis marked a pivotal moment in U.S. foreign policy. President Eisenhower opposed the Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt, demonstrating that the U.S. would not support traditional European imperialism, even against a Soviet-leaning Egypt. This established the U.S. as the dominant Western power and led to the Eisenhower Doctrine (1957), committing the U.S. to defend Middle Eastern nations from communist aggression.
- A) Military occupation: The U.S. did not occupy Egypt
- C) Purchasing the canal: This did not occur
- D) No impact: Incorrect; it was highly significant
