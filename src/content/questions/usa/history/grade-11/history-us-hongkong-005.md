# Question
How did the Hong Kong handover in 1997 reflect broader changes in global power dynamics during the post-Cold War era?

# Options
- [ ] A) It demonstrated continued British imperial dominance
- [x] B) It symbolized the decline of European colonial empires and the rise of China as a major power
- [ ] C) It resulted in immediate Chinese democratization
- [ ] D) It had no significance for global power structures

# Explanation
The 1997 Hong Kong handover symbolized the end of European colonialism and the rise of China as an economic and political power in the post-Cold War era. For the United States, this shift meant adapting to a multipolar world where China, rather than the Soviet Union, would become the primary strategic competitor. The event influenced U.S. policy debates about engagement versus containment of China that continue today.
- A) British dominance: The handover demonstrated Britain's decline, not dominance
- C) Chinese democratization: This did not occur; China remained authoritarian
- D) No significance: Incorrect; it was highly significant geopolitically
