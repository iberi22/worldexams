# Question
Which war resulted in Britain initially acquiring Hong Kong in the 1840s?

# Options
- [ ] A) The Crimean War
- [x] B) The First Opium War
- [ ] C) The Boxer Rebellion
- [ ] D) The Sino-Japanese War

# Explanation
Britain acquired Hong Kong Island following the First Opium War (1839-1842) through the Treaty of Nanking. The war was fought over Britain's right to sell opium in China and represented aggressive British imperial expansion in Asia. This history of colonial exploitation influenced 20th-century Chinese nationalism and continues to affect U.S.-China relations and American understanding of Asian geopolitics.
- A) Crimean War: Fought in Europe (1853-1856), unrelated to Hong Kong
- C) Boxer Rebellion: Occurred in 1900, after Hong Kong was acquired
- D) Sino-Japanese War: Multiple wars, none resulted in British acquisition of Hong Kong
