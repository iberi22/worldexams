# Question
How did the Fall of Saigon influence subsequent U.S. foreign policy in the Cold War?

# Options
- [ ] A) It led to immediate U.S. military interventions in other communist countries
- [x] B) It contributed to the "Vietnam Syndrome," making Americans and policymakers hesitant about foreign military interventions
- [ ] C) It resulted in the U.S. abandoning all containment policies
- [ ] D) It had no lasting impact on U.S. foreign policy

# Explanation
The Fall of Saigon and the Vietnam War defeat created what became known as "Vietnam Syndrome" – a reluctance among Americans and policymakers to commit U.S. forces to foreign conflicts. This influenced U.S. hesitation in subsequent military interventions and led to the War Powers Resolution (1973) limiting presidential war-making authority. The syndrome persisted until the Gulf War (1991), when President George H.W. Bush declared "we've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all."
- A) Immediate interventions: Opposite of what occurred
- C) Abandoning containment: U.S. continued containment in other regions
- D) No impact: Incorrect; it profoundly affected policy
