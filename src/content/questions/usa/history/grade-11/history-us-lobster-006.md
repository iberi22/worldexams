# Question
What broader principle of international law did the Lobster War help establish?

# Options
- [ ] A) The principle of free trade
- [ ] B) The concept of diplomatic immunity
- [x] C) The recognition of exclusive economic zones extending beyond territorial waters
- [ ] D) The right to conduct nuclear testing at sea

# Explanation
The Lobster War contributed to evolving concepts of maritime law, particularly regarding exclusive economic zones (EEZ). The dispute helped establish that coastal nations have sovereign rights over natural resources on and above their continental shelves. This concept was later formalized in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982), granting nations economic control up to 200 nautical miles from their coast.
- A) Free trade: Not the central legal principle at stake
- B) Diplomatic immunity: Unrelated to this maritime dispute
- D) Nuclear testing: Not relevant to the Lobster War
