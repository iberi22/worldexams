# Question
Which U.S. engineering project was inspired by the success of the Suez Canal?

# Options
- [ ] A) The Hoover Dam
- [ ] B) The Golden Gate Bridge
- [x] C) The Panama Canal
- [ ] D) The Transcontinental Railroad

# Explanation
The success of the Suez Canal directly inspired the construction of the Panama Canal, which the United States completed in 1914. Like the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal eliminated the need for long voyages around continents (South America in this case) and demonstrated American engineering prowess and imperial ambitions in the Western Hemisphere, reflecting Theodore Roosevelt's "Big Stick" diplomacy.
- A) Hoover Dam: Built for hydroelectric power and water management, different purpose
- B) Golden Gate Bridge: Not inspired by the Suez Canal
- D) Transcontinental Railroad: Completed in 1869, same year as Suez Canal opening but independently conceived
