# Content Review Report: Jules Generation

**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Reviewer:** Antigravity (Protocol Maintainer)
**Target:** Mexico (EXANI) & USA (SAT) Expansion

## 🚨 Final Verdict: REJECTED (Non-Compliant)

The content generated by Jules does not meet the specifications defined in `docs/specs/EXPANSION_MX_US.md` nor the `Git-Core Protocol` standards.

### 1. ❌ Format Violation
- **Requirement:** Universal Bundles (1 file = 7 question variants).
- **Reality:** Single Question Files (1 file = 1 question).
- **Impact:** This breaks the new difficulty balancing system and file organization strategy.

### 2. ❌ Curriculum mismatch
- **Mexico Requirement:** `Pensamiento Matemático`, `Comprensión Lectora`, `Redacción Indirecta` (EXANI-II).
- **Mexico Reality:** `Historia` coverage (Revolution, Independence). This is secondary content not prioritized in the plan.
- **USA Requirement:** `Math` (Algebra) and `Reading` (Command of Evidence) - SAT format.
- **USA Reality:** `History` trivia (Lobster War, Tokyo Rose).
- **Source Issue:** Questions cite `OpenTDB` (Trivia DB), which is **NOT suitable** for SAT/Academic exam preparation. We need official-style questions.

### 3. ❌ ID & Metadata Mismatch
- IDs used (`US-HIS-11-107`) do not follow the new tracking convention.
- `state: draft` is correct, but the content quality does not align with "Production Ready".

## 🛠️ Remediation Plan

1.  **Stop Jules**: The current generation task must be halted to prevent further pollution of the repo with trivia content.
2.  **Purge**: Delete the `src/content/questions/mexico/historia` and `src/content/questions/usa/history` folders.
3.  **Retrain/Refine Prompt**: Jules needs to be explicitly pointed to the `EXPANSION_MX_US.md` file and instructed to generate **Exam Problems**, not trivia.
4.  **Enforce Bundle Format**: The next run must generate valid `*-bundle.md` files with 7 questions each.
