## Pregunta 1 (Original - Dificultad 2)

**ID:** `CO-ING-07-grammar-001-v1`

### Question

Choose the correct sentence:

### Options

- [ ] A) She don't like pizza.
- [ ] B) She doesn't likes pizza.
- [x] C) She doesn't like pizza.
- [ ] D) She no like pizza.

### Explanation

**Why C is correct:**
In Present Simple, for the third person singular (She, He, It) in negative sentences, we use the auxiliary **"does not"** (or **"doesn't"**) followed by the **base form** of the verb (without 's').
*   Structure: Subject + doesn't + Verb (base).
*   Correct: "She doesn't like..."

**Common Errors:**
*   A: "don't" is for I, you, we, they.
*   B: Double conjugation ("doesn't" + "likes"). The 's' is already in 'does'.
*   D: Missing auxiliary verb.

**Competency evaluated:** Grammar - Present Simple Negation.
