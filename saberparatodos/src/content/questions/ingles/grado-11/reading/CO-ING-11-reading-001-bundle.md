## Reading Passage (Questions 1-4)

Read the following text:

> **The Importance of Biodiversity in Colombia**
>
> *Colombia is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. It is home to approximately 10% of all species on Earth, despite covering only 0.7% of the planet's surface. This extraordinary richness includes over 1,900 species of birds—more than any other country—and thousands of plant, mammal, and amphibian species.*
>
> *However, this natural wealth faces serious threats. Deforestation, illegal mining, and climate change are destroying habitats at an alarming rate. According to environmental organizations, Colombia loses approximately 170,000 hectares of forest every year.*
>
> *Protecting biodiversity is not just an environmental issue; it is also an economic one. Many Colombian communities depend on natural resources for their livelihoods, including fishing, agriculture, and ecotourism. If these ecosystems disappear, so do the jobs and income they provide.*
>
> *The Colombian government has established protected areas and national parks, but experts say more action is needed. International cooperation, stricter laws, and community involvement are essential to preserve this unique natural heritage for future generations.*

**ID:** `CO-ING-11-reading-001-v1`
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5 - Medium)
**CEFR Level:** B1

### Question

According to the text, why is protecting biodiversity also an economic issue?

### Options

- [ ] A) Because Colombia earns money by selling exotic animals to other countries.

### Explanation

**Why C is correct:**

The text explicitly states: "Many Colombian communities depend on natural resources for their livelihoods, including fishing, agriculture, and ecotourism. If these ecosystems disappear, so do the jobs and income they provide."

This directly links environmental protection to economic well-being.

## Question 4 (Medium Variant)

**ID:** `CO-ING-11-reading-001-v4`

**ID:** `CO-ING-11-reading-001-v6`
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 - Difficult)
